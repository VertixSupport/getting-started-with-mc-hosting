## Requesting and Reserving the Server

First, we need to purchase the server and get it set on the panel.
This has to be done manually, as all of the Game Servers are set on different Virtual Private Servers.

First, DM **DevNoah#0001** on Discord, specifying what type of server and the amount of RAM desired.
We offer the following RAM and Pricing List below:
* 4GB Ram - 2 CPU Cores - $7/Month
* 8GB Ram - 3 CPU Cores - $12/Month
* 16GB Ram - 4 CPU Cores - $16/Month
* 32GB Ram - 5 CPU Cores - $30/Month
* 64GB Ram - 7 CPU Cores - $57/Month
* 128GB Ram - 12 CPU Cores - $125/Month

*Note that more CPU Cores can be added on for an additional cost*

Once you've done that, you should see a channel opened in the Vertix Studios Discord Server.
*If you are not in the server, then join by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/G4549AgC2q)*.
The channel should have your username, followed by `-invoice`.

## Paying for the Server
Now, once in the channel, you should see a message that looks something like this:

This invoice shows the amount, your Invoice ID, Case Number, Email, and Status.
Click on the *Click Me* under the *Pay Now* field.

You should see a new page open that displays something like this:
![](https://devnoah.reeee.ee/53x2JV_j0.png)

The minimum amount due is half of the buying price. You can pay that minimum amount, or any amount above the minimum until you reach the total amount due.

Once you have successfully payed for the server through PayPal, **react to the checkmark that was on the message in the Discord channel**.

If payed in full, the message should edit, and show something like this:

Once this embed shows, simply mention DevNoah in the invoice channel, and we'll begin working on your server!

## Using the Server and Connecting to it
We can't provide too much information about this yet, mainly due to the sensitive nature of our Panel, but another article will be published soon with more information on this topic.
